# OC Radio Chat

This repository is to hold the chat application for OC Radio.

The eventual plan is to use NodeJS and AngularJS to streamline the whole application and make it available for iOS, Android, and perhaps other platforms.

In the meantime, see the [live demo](https://www.zacharyfoutz.com/chat "zChat").


## TODO

  * Add user timeouts and one account login
  * Add two factor authentication and/or google captcha
  * Add Twitter, Facebook, and G+ logins

  * Make login page more pleasant by:
      * Use login button as primary left aligned button, move register and reset pass to the right.

  * Make better user options _see lib/js/index.js line 133_
